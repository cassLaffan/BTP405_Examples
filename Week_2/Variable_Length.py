'''
In this file, we'll be looking at the unpacking operator *.
When in front of a parameter in a function, it allows for a varying number
of arguments. When used in front of an iterable (such as a list
or tuple), it will just unpack it. That's useful for print statements!

def greet(*names):
    for name in names:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")


# Here, we can make a function where we don't know what the names
# of our arguments will be!
def print_info(**kwargs):
	for key, value in kwargs.items():
		print(f"{key}: {value}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
	name_list = ["Cass", "Tav", "Craig"]
	family_list = ["Self", "Brother", "Dad"]
    # Let's see how * unpacks the list above
	print(*name_list)
    
	# Now, we'll see how we can treat iterables as argument lists
	greet(*name_list)
    
	print_info(names = name_list, family = family_list)
